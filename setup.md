title: Setup
---

These instructions set out how to obtain and install the course pre-requisites for Linux. It is assumed
that you have:
* access to the BASH shell on a fairly modern Linux system
* sufficient disk space (~1GB) to store the software and data
You *do not* need root/administrator level access.

Note: There are other ways to install these tools, and it should also be possible to run the exercises on
non-Linux systems. However, this is not covered here.

To prepare for the course you will need:

* The sample dataset from *whatever url*
* The snakemake software installed *whatever way*
* The GEdit or Nano editors (other text editors will work but we only provide specific setup instructions
  for GEdit and Nano).

Add editor settings here see screenshots from the workbook.

Also the settings for Nano I can work out.
