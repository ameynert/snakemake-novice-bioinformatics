## Temporary files in Snakemake



This chapter for:

reminder of how Snakemake regards missing intermediate files
temporary files
(protected files - the salmon and kallito indexes are good examples)
shadow directories (useful for parallel operation)
removing all outputs (--delete-all-output) (like make clean)
--touch mode probably fits here
